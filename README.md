# Explanation of the graph

## Problems I faced
I faced few problems throughout. The main problem I had was being unable to properly read and plot the data from the .csv files initially, I fixed this by directly converting the data to a numpy array, and using that like any other dataset.

## What does the data show?
The sample size was small, and so, it's hard to get accurate results (the law of large numbers), but from what I gathered, there seems to be a downward trend towards the middle of the graph, and a sudden surge upward a bit before the end, this is then followed by a downward trend again right at the end.

The average for both Yr and Storm is -3 and -3.5 respectively, and so is their mean, since there are only two values for each of the data-points, the arithmetic mean and average ends up being the same.

The variation width for both the Yr and Storm data are 5 (-1 - -6) and 6 (0 - -6) respectively, and 4 (-1.5 - -5.5) for the averaged data.

## Differences between Yr and Storm
Yr seems to show a generally higher temperature, as both its average and mode data is above Storm's.

## Notes
* I added comments throughout the code in places I saw fit.
* The average and mean ends up being the same, and so, I only show the average.

## Sources
I used sites like **StackOverflow** to quickly get reminded of things.

I also got some inspiration from **Ola**, who had the initial idea for fullscreen mode.
