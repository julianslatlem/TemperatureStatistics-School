# Explanation of the graph

## Problems I faced
I faced few problems throughout.

## What does the data show?
The dataset was minimal, and so, it's hard to get accurate results (Big Numbers Law), but from what I gathered, there seems to be a downward trend towards the middle of the graph, and a sudden surge upward right before the end, this is then succeded by a downward trend again right at the end.

The average for both Yr and Storm is -3 and -3.5 respectively, and so is their mean, since there are only two values for each of the data-points, the arithmetic mean and average ends up being the same.

## Notes
I added comments throughout the code in places I saw fit.

## Sources
I used sites like **StackOverflow** to quickly get reminded of things.

I also got some inspiration from **Ola**, who had the initial idea for fullscreen mode.
